    <p>Coding challenges in December might be tricky.</p>
  </fieldset>


  <p>If you like to code you need to have a look into the project <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of
      Code</a>.</p>

  <p>Since many years each day in december before christmas a new challenge is published to be solved by coding -
    sometimes by including some thinking.</p>

  <p>This year they have wrapped their puzzle challenges into a story about Elves in a Submarine... :). The challenges
    usually require some tricky computing that result a number that you have to insert to be verified. When correct you
    get a gold star. There are 2 stars per day possible.</p>


  <h2>Try out a interactive programming tool</h2>

  <p>I did some using an approach that is well known to the friends coding in Python: Jupyter Notebooks.
    It is a document based approach that combines markdown documentation and interactive inline coding.
    In VSCode there is a nodejs version available called <b>Node.js Notebooks</b> supporting JavaScript and TypeScript
    that you may find ideal for solving these challenges.</p>

  <p>Happy coding.</p>

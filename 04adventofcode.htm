    <p>Coding challenges in December might be tricky.</p>
  </fieldset>


  <p>If you like to code you need to have a look into the project <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of
      Code</a>.</p>

  <p>Since many years each day in december before christmas a new challenge is published to be solved by coding -
    sometimes by including some thinking.</p>

  <p>This year they have wrapped their puzzle challenges into a story about Elves in a Submarine... :). The challenges
    usually require some tricky computing that result a number that you have to insert to be verified. When correct you
    get a gold star. There are 2 stars per day possible.</p>


  <h2>Try out a interactive programming tool</h2>

  <p>I did some using an approach that is well known to the friends coding in Python: <b>Jupyter Notebooks</b>.</p>
  <p>It is a document based approach that combines markdown documentation and interactive inline coding.</p>

  <p>
    In VSCode there is quiet good support for notebooks even on other languages:
    <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels">https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels</a>.
    It is already an impressive list and tslab is providing support for TypeScript and JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>Installation is quiet easy by installing using npm: <code>npm install -g tslab</code> and <code>tslab install</code>.</p>
  <p>You may find ideal for verifying code snippets but also for solving these challenges.</p>
  <p>Bonus: GitHub shows the files in a nice formatting:
    <a href="https://github.com/yunabe/tslab-examples/blob/master/notebooks/getting_started.ipynb">https://github.com/yunabe/tslab-examples/blob/master/notebooks/getting_started.ipynb</a>
  </p>

  <p>Happy coding.</p>

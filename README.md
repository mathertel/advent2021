# Advent Calendar 2021 Web Technologies

This Advent Calendar is hosted in <https://mathertel.github.io/advent2021/index.htm>

An Advent calendar is a special calendar with 24 secrets behind doors used to count the days of Advent in anticipation of Christmas.
You can find also many online following the tradition founded by the German Lutherans in the 19th and 20th centuries.

This one was created from my collection of useful links and snippets regarding the possibilities of the native browser technologies in 2020/2021. It focuses on using the CSS available as of 2021 to overcome the restrictions of older browsers.

Behind each door you can find something - just for fun or education.

I spend some time to write some text to not just provide code snippets. I also added helpful links on some topics you may find more detailled information.

Doors will be available on each of the 24 days in 2021 and will stay open.
